## 🛠 Software Engineering & Infrastructure

###  Project & Environment Management
* **Modern Python Tooling**
    * **uv Project Workflow**: Transitioned to a full project-based workflow using `uv`. By utilizing `pyproject.toml` and lockfiles, I ensured high-performance dependency management and strictly reproducible development environments.

###  Code Quality & Static Typing
* **Static Analysis Ecosystem**
    * **Pyright Configuration**: Implemented a `pyrightconfig.json` file to standardize type-checking rules across the project, ensuring consistent error reporting and strict type safety.
    * **Pylance**: Integrated as the core high-performance language server to provide advanced static analysis and intelligent auto-complete.
    * **pandas-stubs**: Utilized to bring static typing to the Pandas library, allowing for stricter validation of DataFrame operations.

* **Advanced Structural Typing**
    * **TypedDict**: Leveraged from the `typing` module to define explicit schemas for dictionaries, ensuring data consistency and a self-documenting codebase.
